\title{This function identifies the columns in a sequential model design matrix that are responsible for separation.}
\usage{
detect_sepcols_sl(y, X, rational = FALSE)

sepcols_sl(y, X, rational = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{the dependent variable. Works for ordered factors, factors, characters numeric of boolean. Works best if it is an ordered factor, else we treat it alphanuemrically ascneidng just as as.ordered.}

\item{X}{a design matrix, e.g. generated via a call to 'model.matrix'. This means we expect that X already contains the desired contrasts for factors (e.g., dummies) and any other expanded columns (e.g., for polynominals).}

\item{rational}{should rational arithmetic be used.}
}
\description{
This function identifies the columns in a sequential model design matrix that are responsible for separation.
}
\details{
We solve a linear program in this function that operates only on y and X, so without a specific model. This program corresponds to detecting which columns in the design matrix leads to infinite MLE for some link functions, but it is more general as there are links that can still give finite estimates even though there is separation. Hence this function detects separation even in the case of (seemingly) finite estimates or if there is no warning. The prime example is using the log link in logistic regression.
