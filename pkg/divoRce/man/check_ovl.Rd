\title{General overlap check.}
\usage{
check_ovl(y, X, rational = FALSE, model = c("bcl", "cl", "acl", "sl", "osm"))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{outcome vector.}

\item{X}{design matrix.}

\item{rational}{should rational arithmetic be used.}

\item{model}{what model class is intended to be fitted? Can be any of "b" for binary, "bcl" for baseline-category link, "cl" for cumulative link, "acl" for adjacent-category link. "sl" for sequential link, "osm" for ordered stereotype model. If missing it defaults to cumulative link for ordinal y and baseline-category for everything else.}
}
\value{
a Boolean; either 'TRUE' if there is overlap or 'FALSE' if not.
}
\description{
This function checks for overlap. It is a low-level function for a response vector y and a design matrix X.
