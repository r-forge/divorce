\title{This function identifies the columns in a design matrix for a baseline-category link model that have an infinite MLE, due to separation. Note this is due to separation which includes the case of a design matrix that doesn't have full rank.}
\usage{
detect_sepcols_bcl(y, X, rational = FALSE)

sepcols_bcl(y, X, rational = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{the outcome variable. Can be factor, numeric, character or boolean. Works best if it is a factor.}

\item{X}{a design matrix, e.g. generated via a call to 'model.matrix'. This means we expect that X already contains the desired contrasts for factors (e.g., dummies) and any other expanded columns (e.g., for polynomials).}

\item{rational}{should rational arithmetic be used.}
}
\description{
This function identifies the columns in a design matrix for a baseline-category link model that have an infinite MLE, due to separation. Note this is due to separation which includes the case of a design matrix that doesn't have full rank.
}
\details{
We solve a linear program in this function that operates only on y and X, so without a specific model. This program corresponds to detecting which columns in the design matrix leads to infinite MLE for some link functions, but it is more general as there are links that can still give finite estimates even though there is separation. Hence this function detects separation even in the case of (seemingly) finite estimates or if there is no warning. The prime example is using the log link in logistic regression.
